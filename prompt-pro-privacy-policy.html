    <h1>Prompt Pro - Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy explains how Prompt Pro handles your information. We take your privacy seriously and have designed our app to maximize privacy while providing excellent teleprompter functionality.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Storage</h2>
    <p>Prompt Pro is designed with privacy in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All files and scripts are stored locally on your device</li>
        <li>No data is transmitted to external servers</li>
        <li>No personal information is collected</li>
        <li>No analytics or tracking systems are implemented</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>File Access</h2>
    <p>Prompt Pro requests access to files only when you choose to import them. These files:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remain stored locally on your device</li>
        <li>Are only accessible within the app</li>
        <li>Can be deleted by you at any time</li>
        <li>Are never uploaded to any servers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, security is managed through your device's built-in security features. We recommend keeping your iOS device updated and secured with a passcode.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Prompt Pro does not integrate with any third-party services or analytics platforms. The app functions completely offline after installation.</p>

    <h2>App Store Data</h2>
    <p>The only information collected is standard App Store analytics provided by Apple, which is not linked to your identity or content.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app does not collect any personal information from users of any age, including children under 13 years of age.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the app store listing.</p>
